# THE SWARM — Domain Context

## Core Concepts

### Nest Capacity
The maximum number of workers the colony can support. When workers reach capacity, the `larvaPipeline` is blocked — existing workers continue normally, but no new workers hatch until capacity is expanded. This makes `nestCapacity` a real gameplay mechanic (previously cosmetic/dead code).

Capacity is expanded via:
- **Dig workers**: +1 capacity per second per worker (integer-only accumulation, 20 ticks at 50ms = +1)
- **Warehouse building**: +25 per level (soft-capped after Lv.5 via `softCapEffectiveness`)
- **"Expand" decision**: +10 one-time from DecisionSystem

Base capacity: 25. Reset to 25 on prestige.

### Workers
The ant population. Workers consume 0.5 food/sec each (linear). They can be assigned to:
- **Gather**: produce food
- **Tend**: increase egg hatch rate
- **Dig**: increase nest capacity
- **Guard**: soldiers for combat
- **Researchers**: research projects

Unassigned workers produce at half gather rate. Worker efficiency follows a diminishing-returns curve (`1/(1 + 0.0005 × (workers − 500))` for workers > 500).

### Phases
6 sequential phases: EGG_LAYING → COLONY → COMBAT → EXPANSION → SPACE → TRANSCENDENCE. Phase transitions are gated by resource/worker thresholds and battles. Each phase unlocks new panels, mechanics, and resources.

### Pipelines
Rate-based O(1) processing: `eggPipeline`, `larvaPipeline`, `soldierPipeline`. Each has `count` (rate) and `progress` (accumulated). No per-item timers.

### Prestige
Reset loop: sacrifice all progress for Legacy Points. LP give +2% production each (additive). Prestige tree has 8 upgrades costing 57 LP total. Requires all buildings Lv.5 + 100K food lifetime.

### Resources
Integers only (`Math.floor()`). Food, wood, stone, nectar (phases 1-4). Void crystals, antimatter, dark matter (phase 5+).
